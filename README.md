# JAVASCRIPT DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
## Chapter 1 : Big O Notation
### Objectives
- Motivate the need for sth like Big O Notation
- Describe what Big O Notation is 
- Simplify Big O Expressions
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O Notation
- Describe what a logarithm is

### Introducing
- Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting
- It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow
